      "summary": "Those who are not faithful to principles become open to evil, to have evil done to them or to do evil themselves (Pramoedya Ananta Toer)\nHealth supremacism is an ideology. Supremacist thinking always starts with an imaginary division of the world into supposedly ‘superior’ and ‘inferior’ people. Health supremacism is the idea that someone who is deemed ‘healthy’ is superior to someone who has some form of impairment to their health; any form of perceived illness or presumed health impairment — on this line of thinking — makes you a categorically ‘inferior’ person.",

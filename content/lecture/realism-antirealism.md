_During Lent 2018 I gave four lectures about the concept of realism and the way it has been controversial. I delivered these lectures to the Part II (i.e. third year undergraduate) students reading Philosophy at Cambridge. The following lecture notes I distributed as hand-outs at the time._

## LECTURE 1
---

### 1. Metaphysical realism 

It seems reasonable to suppose that realism is a claim about what there is. It is a metaphysical view. Metaphysical realism claims that things exist, and exist entirely independently of the beliefs we have about them, of any methods we may have of finding out about them, of the concepts we have of them, or of our experience of them. In brief, things exist regardless of whether we come to know them or not. One way of denying metaphysical realism would be to deny the existence of the things in question. For example, error-theories in meta-ethics claim that the moral facts our moral beliefs purport to be about don’t exist, and conclude that all moral beliefs are false. Such theories often are a philosophical last resort.

### 2. Specific domains 

But what about accepting the existence of things, and denying that they exist (mind-)independently instead? Denying independence is more plausible for some domains than others: (a) Beauty, for example, clearly in part depends on our experience or judgments; (b) The idea that moral facts are relative to our affective responses or conceptual schemes is at least respectable; (c) To claim that the material or physical world is mind-dependent is, however, radical. These differences bring out that realism is best treated as a theory about a specific domain.

### 3. Idealism 

Philosophers such as Berkeley (1685–1753), Bradley (1846–1924), and Bosanquet (1848–1923) deny independence for any domain. They claim that there are no entities we come across whose existence is independent of the mind and its cognitive activities. Their idealist assumption is that the act of knowing and what is known are not independent but interdependent. Hence, the very idea of something existing entirely independently of our knowledge of it, they think, is incoherent. Traditional arguments here take the form of Berkeley’s Master Argument. Berkeley suggested that we cannot even conceive of a thing that is independent of its being known by us, because no matter how hard we try, we end up conceiving an object perceived, i.e. an object that is known.

### 4. Epistemological realism

Epistemological realism responds to the idealist charge. Its main thesis is that the knower doesn’t affect what is known. Oxford and Cambridge realism emerged in the early twentieth century, with slogans like “You can no more act upon the object by knowing it than you can ‘please the Dean and Chapter by stroking the dome of St. Paul’s’” (Cook Wilson, 1904). If knowing doesn’t modify the known, then our acquaintance with things is an awareness of them just as they are, regardless of our awareness of them. Hence, we can know the world as it is independent of our knowledge of it, even if having such knowledge (trivially) depends on our knowing the object. There no longer is a problem with taking our beliefs, experiences, and theories to be about mind-independent objects. If that is right, then the epistemological realist has removed the idealist obstacle to metaphysical realism.

### 5. Semantic realism

Semantic realism has become the target of a more sophisticated set of criticisms of metaphysical realism. The semantic realist claims that our statements or theories (about a specific domain) are true or false entirely independently of our understanding of those statements or ability to recognise their truth value. For example, take Goldbach’s conjecture: ‘Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes’. We may understand the sentence, but have (as of yet) no way of determining the truth- value of the statement. The semantic realist can say that it nonetheless has one, because its truth or falsity depends just on some mind-independent fact, e.g. some properties of numbers.

### 6. A good target 

Notice, metaphysical realism is only tenable if semantic realism is tenable, at least if we accept Tarski’s simple T-schema: ‘Snow is white’ is true iff snow is white. If the truth of ‘Snow is white’ is not independent from our understanding or recognition (i.e. if semantic realism is false), then the fact that snow is white itself is not independent of our understanding or recognition (i.e. metaphysical realism is false). Another reason for considering semantic realism as the most interesting gloss of what the realist is committed to, is that not all controversial classes of statements require the realist to commit to the existence of some disputed entities, i.e. to make a metaphysical pronouncement about what there is (e.g. realism about the future, realism about ethics ).

### 7. Bivalence 

One of Michael Dummett’s central claims is that the semantic realist must accept bivalence. Why is this? The semantic realist maintains that what makes a statement of a disputed class true or false does not depend on our ability to understand the meaning of the statement or our ability to recognise its truth value, but depends on whether some mind-independent fact the statement describes obtains. Either that fact obtains, or it doesn’t obtain. Hence, either the statement is true or the statement is false. So understood, it follows that the statements of the disputed class have verification-transcendent truth conditions. As we’ll see next week, Dummett’s case for resisting bivalence builds on this implication.

### 8. External realism

Another influential way of criticising metaphysical realism through semantics is developed by Hilary Putnam. Tim Button, in his book The Limits of Realism, devoted to this criticism, presents Putnam as characterising external realism with three principles: Independence, Correspondence, Cartesianism. Together, these principles combine metaphysical, epistemological, and semantic claims. Putnam calls this ‘external realism’, and many have followed him.

### 9. Independence

We saw this claim in formulating Metaphysical Realism. The world or some specific domain is made up of objects that are mind-, language-, and theory- independent. This principle is generally accepted as necessary for external realism. Some, such as Michael Devitt, also claim that it is sufficient.

### 10. Correspondence

Truth involves some sort of correspondence relation between words or ideas and external things and structures of things. If the realist accepts the principle of Independence, it is very natural to also accept Correspondence.

### 11. Cartesianism

Even an ideal theory might be radically false. If truth consists in correspondence, and falsity in failure of correspondence, then we have no guarantee that our best scientific theory is true. This could be for mundane reasons like our limitations, or because we are brains in vats (Putnam’s thought experiment). To think that our best scientific theory must be true entails a rejection of realism, because it would make truth no longer turn simply on mind- and language-independent fact.

## LECTURE 2

### 1. Verification independent truth conditions 

Are the truth values of the sentences about a domain (the ‘disputed class’ of sentences) independent of our cognitive access to them? Dummett identified those who answer ‘yes’ as semantic realists. He frames this position in terms of a commitment to bivalence. For example, take a statement about the past: “Caesar stepped into the Rubicon with his right foot first.” According to the realist, this statement is true iff Caesar stepped into the Rubicon with his right foot first. Such a condition either obtained or did not obtain, it seems. Yet someone who grasps all this may still have no means of determining whether it obtains or not—whether the statement is true or not. So conceived, truth is a non-epistemic notion.

### 2. How to beat a realist? 

The semantic anti-realist maintains that truth is instead an epistemic notion: whether a statement is true or not depends on whether we can correctly assert it, which in turn presupposes that we have some means of determining whether its truth conditions obtain or. But note, the anti-realist argument against the realist cannot consist in showing that we should adopt their epistemic notion of truth. They must also argue that the realist anti-epistemic notion of truth is incoherent. This is because the two notions of truth are not obviously incompatible: we may simply adopt both.

### 3. Need for generality 

We must also keep in mind that the realist need only make an existential, not a universal claim: at least for some domain the non-epistemic concept of truth applies. This suggests that instead of presenting a counter-example, the anti-realist must be looking for a general argument against the non-epistemic notion of truth.

### 4. Truth, meaning, and understanding 

Dummett adopts a specific but independently motivated theory of meaning. The crucial thing about it: the meaning of a statement is tied both to truth and to understanding. The meaning of a sentence is given by giving the conditions under which the sentence is true. And to understand a sentence is to know its meaning. But what do we know when we know the meaning of a sentence? To avoid circularity or regress, we cannot answer this in terms of our understanding of another sentence. So Tarski’s T-schema is useless as a theory of understanding. Dummett suggests that instead we must take knowledge of meaning to be a kind of practical knowledge. To know the meaning of ‘S’ is to have implicit knowledge: it is to know how to use the sentence, in particular to be able to distinguish situations in which a sentence can be correctly uttered from situations in which it cannot.

### 5. Acquisition argument 

The first way the anti-realist can object to the semantic realist is to question whether we can even form a conception of a verification transcendent truth condition. Consider, a language must be learnable, i.e. it must be possible for someone to acquire knowledge of what its sentences mean. If meaning is use, then they must be able to acquire an ability to tell when the statement can be correctly asserted. The challenge to the realist is now to explain how a novice could learn what sentences in the disputed class mean, given that even a competent speaker may be ignorant of what accessible conditions suffice for affirming or denying the claim. If there is no communicable understanding of what it takes for certain assertions of sentences of the class to be correct, then it seems impossible to learn their meaning. Dummett presents this argument most clearly in “The Reality of the Past” (1969).

### 6. Truth-value links 

One realist response is to rely on our grasp of sentences which are unproblematic in order to explain our grasp of sentences which have problematic truth conditions. I can correctly utter ‘Caesar stepped into the Rubicon with his right foot first’ iff ‘Caesar stepped into the Rubicon with his right foot first’ could be correctly uttered by some Roman soldier at the time. John McDowell (1978) has objected to this strategy. He doesn’t deny there could be such links. But using them to explain what we know when we understand one sentence with verification-transcendent truth conditions would presuppose that we understand some other sentence (i.e. the one uttered by the soldier) with verification-transcendent truth conditions.

### 7. Compositionality 

A potentially better response is to exploit the compositionality of language. If we know the semantically significant parts of many sentences, and we know the syntax of the problematic sentence, we can grasp the problematic sentence’s truth- conditions. In this way we can explain our understanding of the meaning of sentences that we cannot determine the truth of in terms our understanding of the semantic parts and syntactic structure of sentences that we are able to recognise as true or false. So if compositional semantics is acceptable, then this suggestion undermines the acquisition argument against realism.

### 8. Manifestation argument 

Let’s suppose that we are able to acquire knowledge of what sentences with verification-transcendent truth conditions mean. Dummett has a second argument against the realist. Recall, knowledge of meaning is fundamentally a practical ability to decide the truth-value of the sentence. So we should be able to manifest that knowledge in actual linguistic practice. For example, your knowledge of what ‘It is raining’ means can manifest itself in asserting it in the appropriate conditions, and refraining from doing so when it doesn’t rain. Accordingly, if we indeed know the truth- conditions of the sentences of a disputed class, then we must be able to manifest this knowledge in our use of those sentences. Yet if the truth conditions of these sentences are verification-transcendent, then there may be no procedure (known to us) for deciding the truth-value of the sentence. Hence, it may be that we are not able to manifest a practical ability to decide the truth-value of the sentence. Therefore, we do not have knowledge of the meaning of verification-transcendent truth conditions after all.

### A missing ability 

What the realist seems to be lacking is “a practical ability which stands to understanding an evidence-transcendent truth condition as recognitional skills stand to decidable truth-conditions” (Wright, Realism, Meaning and Truth, p. 23) Indeed, we cannot simply recognise the truth value of certain statements if their truth conditions are verification-transcendent. But that doesn’t show that there is no other ability that could do the job. P.F. Strawson (1976) suggests that an ability to verify a statement is just one way of manifesting understanding. An ability to recognise conditions that constitute evidence, more or less good, for or against the truth of the sentence, also manifests understanding of the sentence, even if such conditions are not its truth-conditions.

## LECTURE 3

### 1. External Realism

Recall, following Button (The Limits of Realism), we can see Putnam as characterising external realism with three principles: Independence: The world or some specific domain is made up of objects that are mind-, language-, and theory-independent; Correspondence: Truth involves some sort of correspondence relation between words or ideas and external things and structures of things; Cartesianism: Even an ideal theory might be radically false.

### 2. Formalising external realism

Let our theory of the world be expressed in language L, with a vocabulary of names (‘c1’, ‘c2’, ...) and predicates (‘R1’, ‘R2’, ...). (We can treat the function symbols in the same way, but I will ignore those for simplicity.) Let the external world be a model W , with a domain W that consists of the objects which make up the world (the ‘fundamental ontology’). Each name, ‘c’, maps to the object cW in W, and each predicate ‘R’ is mapped to a set RW of objects in W. We assume here that whatever the external realist claims about the world, it should be something that can be represented formally in this way. So when we claim that the moon is round, we can represent its truth
conditions as follows: ‘Rc1’ is true iff c1W ∈ RW.

### 3. Adequacy 

Should the externalist accept this interpretation of their theory? The model- theoretic interpretation of external realism is relatively innocent. It merely assumes that the correspondence between language and world can be successfully represented or modelled in model-theoretic terms; it doesn’t assume that the model is real or the actual truth maker. Moreover, the interpretation seems an excellent way to confirm Independence, Correspondence, and Cartesianism: the language and the domain are entirely separate, yet each term in the language corresponds to something in the domain if a statement is true, which nonetheless leaves room falsehoods and better and worse models.

### 4. Putnam’s model-theoretic argument

However, now it is easy to see that for each situation that makes a theory true there are others situations that do so. A simple ‘permutation argument’ shows this. A permutation is a bijection from a set onto itself: each object in the set gets mapped to an object in the set (possibly itself), and no two objects get mapped to the same object. As long as we respect the structure of W , we can arrive at a distinct but isomorphic model P that renders our theory true. So if we now ask the external realist about what ‘the moon’, ‘c1’, refers to, she will have to admit that it is either c1W or c1P . 

### 5. Indeterminacy 

What exactly is the upshot? The external realist claims that the world is largely independent of us and our sentences are true just if they correspond to the external things and structures of things external world. What the model-theoretic argument shows is that, if there is any way to make the theory true, then there are many ways of making the theory true. Putnam writes that “nature does not single out any one correspondence between our terms and external things” (1981: 41). Therefore, there seems to be an indeterminacy in the relation between our theory and the world. Not even a true theory satisfies Correspondence, because a true theory doesn’t determine a single way for the world to be.
 
### 6. Unintended models

What goes wrong here, clearly, is that our theory of the world should be understood as a theory only about one intended model, i.e. the model W in which ‘the moon’ refers to the moon and not to something else. Yes, there are strange models that are isomorphic the the intended one but these should be dismissed. But how?

- Causal constraint? Isn’t reference fixed by a causal relation between external elements and our terms or concepts? Recall Saul Kripke’s theory of rigid designators. This is a causal theory of reference: a necessary condition for a term to refer to an object is that there is a chain of causation from an initial baptism to current usage. An intended interpretation, we may think, should respect such causal connections. However, even if causation is necessary for reference, it is not sufficient. Furthermore, we can have true theories about domains that include objects with which we cannot interact causally. 

- Eliteness constraint? Perhaps we can instead find the desired constraint on reference in the specialness of W ? Notice, the model-theoretic argument delivers many pseudo-
properties. David Lewis suggests that we should focus only on the ‘sparse’ ones. “Sharing of them makes for qualitative similarity, they carve at the joints, they are intrinsic, they are highly specific, ... there are only just enough of them to characterise things completely and without redundancy” (1986:60) So the genuine properties (e.g. being a cat) are, in a sense, special. Well, wouldn’t that be nice! The problem is, how do we know this? And what determines that our predicates pick out ‘elite’ or ‘sparse’ properties?

### 7. Just more theory

Any specific constraint is likely to be controversial on its own terms. However, the best way to fortify the model-theoretic argument is by showing that any constraint offered is problematic. How would you do that? Well, just consider what any such constraint would have to be. It will have to take the following form: “X fixes reference”, where ‘X’ refers to some relevant phenomenon (causation, sparseness) that is supposed to fix the reference of our terms. But the sentence ‘X fixes reference’ is itself just more theory! What does it mean? If it is part of our theory of the world, it is itself subject to the model theoretic argument. And if it isn’t part of our theory of the world, then what kind of claim is it? (Putnam and Button suggest it would be a magical theory.)

### 8. Question begging? 

Doesn’t this fortification beg the question? The point that causation, say, fixes reference is not a semantic one. The realist doesn’t say that reference is fixed because ‘causation’ means what it does! They say that reference is fixed by causation. That fact doesn’t depend on our theory, our thoughts, or our experience. To assume that it does begs the question. Hartry Field (1972) suggests that it is simply up to empirical science to tell philosophy what the reference-fixing relation is and how it works. Perhaps. But note, this leaves the door open for a situation in which we have no clue what our terms refer to, yet still accept a theory that promises us that they do in fact refer.

### 9. Semantic scepticism

The external realist is driven to accept a form of semantic scepticism. This is really one of the interesting points Putnam’s arguments bring out. To be sure, the Cartesian principle already acknowledged the worry that appearances may deceive. But scepticism about semantics seems rather different. If we embrace scepticism about the semantics of our language, then we acknowledge the possibility that we are hopelessly wrong about what our words refer to. But how could we even represent or express this worry? It must be expressible using the simple disquotational strategy: “I can doubt that ‘The moon’ might not refer to the moon.” But if we are in doubt about what ‘the moon’ refers to, we are in doubt about what the disquotational sentence itself is about. Semantic scepticism is incoherent and thereby self-refuting.

## LECTURE 4

### 1. Manifestation and understanding

Recall, Dummett’s first way of objecting to the semantic realist was to question whether we can acquire a conception of a verification- transcendent truth condition. He thought not. His second and more powerful objection was that we must also be able to manifest knowledge of truth conditions in our use of a sentence. The problem is that, if the truth conditions of a sentence are verification- transcendent, it may be that we are not able to manifest a practical ability to decide its truth-value. We may simply lack such an ability. A commitment to verification- transcendent truth conditions is what brings about this difficulty. So, an anti-realist must keep truth tied to verification, to the act of establishing the correctness of an assertion.

### 2. Realism and anti-realism

Where exactly do the two positions diverge? Imagine, a single die is placed in a black box which is then closed. We shake the box. Now I utter U: “Currently the upper face of the die shows 6 dots”.

- Scenario 1: Following U, the box is opened, and the die’s upper face shows six dots
- Scenario 2: Following U, the box is left closed

The realist explains the truth of the statement in both scenarios in terms of the (mind- independent) state of the die. The anti-realist explains the truth of the statement in Scenario 1 in terms of our ability to verify the sentence, i.e. recognise its correctness as an assertion or judgment. Can the anti-realist do the same in Scenario 2? Yes. But now consider

- Scenario 3: Following U, all humans lose their capacity for visual and tactile sensations

Here the realist and the anti-realist will diverge. The realist will still accept U as true. Yet the anti-realist seems to have clear grounds to consider U meaningless in Scenario 3: in that scenario the sentence is not just not verified, it is no longer verifiable.

### 3. Theory of meaning 

The anti-realist theory of meaning is (broadly) verificationist. It is fine to understand meaning in terms of truth-conditions, as the realist does too. But we should not understand truth conditions in terms of truth (as the realist does), but in terms of the conditions under which a sentence would be verified, i.e. when we would correctly assert it (verificationism). Dummett emphasises that a theory of meaning is not only a theory of truth, but also a theory of understanding. This connection to understanding is captured by the connection with conditions for correct assertion. One understands a sentence iff one has a capacity to distinguish between conditions under which the sentence can be correctly used and conditions in which it would not be correctly used. Dummett assumes that to have such a capacity requires being able to manifest it.

### 4. A new logical landscape 

A sentence is true iff it can be verified. Some sentences cannot be verified simply because they are false. A sentence is false iff we can falsify it (can recognise that its truth-conditions do not obtain). We all recognise that we cannot in Cambridge correctly say “we are in Oxford”. Because we can falsify that sentence, we are not able to verify it. But notice, an inability to verify a sentence is not sufficient for the sentence to be falsifiable (or false). Some sentences may be both unverifiable and unfalsifiable. So for any sentence, it is either (i) verifiable, (ii) unverifiable, (iii) falsifiable, or (iv) unfalsifiable. We can now easily see how classical bivalence breaks down. Classically, S is not true iff S is false, and S is not false iff S is true. But the anti-realist accepts that S can be not verifiable (i.e. not true) and not falsifiable (i.e. not false).
 
### 5. External Realism? 

If we were to accept this kind of theory of meaning, what would this mean for external realism, i.e. Independence, Correspondence, Cartesianism? Should we now reject Independence? Not necessarily. C.S. Lewis asked us to consider a mass- extinction scenario: ‘If all minds should disappear from the universe, the stars would still go on in their courses.’ Is this verifiable? Well, based on what we know about the world, we should accept that this scenario is possible. If it is possible, then the stars exist independent of our mind and theory. Indeed, we know that human minds did not bring the stars or mountains into existence! But all this is unspectacular, because we are reading Independence internally: we are treating it as part of an empirical theory can safely construe its meaning in anti-realist terms. The same holds for Correspondence.

### 6. Brains in vats 

The real culprit is Cartesianism: even an ideal theory can be false. (In more Dummettian terms: falsity is independent from our ability to falsify). If we accept this then ‘external’ versions of Independence and Correspondence roll out as philosophically substantive, metaphysical theses. The model theoretic argument aims to show that this generates semantic scepticism. Semantic scepticism is self-refuting. Putnam has a famous simple argument against Cartesianism: Brains in Vats (BIVs). If even our ideal theory can be false, then we must accept the following: we could in fact all be brains in vats. But we cannot accept that.

1. The BIV word ‘brain’ doesn’t refer to brains 
2. My word ‘brain’ refers to brains
3. I am not a BIV

The second premise is defended by reductio argument: assume it doesn’t, then what does premise 1 mean? So we cannot accept Cartesianism.

### 7. Resisting Cartesianism

Putnam thinks we should become internal realists. But he has offered a number of distinct formulations of this positive theory. Tim Button distinguishes ‘nonrealism’ (1970s), ‘justificationism’ (1980s), and ‘natural realism’ (1990s). Natural realism is Putnam’s most developed position. But in each, Putnam rejects Cartesianism by making truth dependent on our abilities to verify or falsify a theory. 

### 8. Natural realism 

Putnam’s mature view assumes that the problems disappear once we have sorted out our philosophy of perception. How can our terms be about the mind- independent world? This is a problem only if we assume that our access to the world is purely theoretical or cognitive. That we are always piecing together a picture based on subjective evidence. But this can be resisted if we adopt a naïve realism. In experience the world presents itself to us immediately. Our word ‘Felix’ refers to Felix, and we have a grasp of this connection because we have a grasp of both ‘Felix’ and of Felix and know how to use the one to refer to the other. Putnam: “How could the question ‘How does language hook on to the world?’ even appear to pose a difficulty, unless the retort ‘How can there be a problem about talking about, say, houses and trees when we see them all the time?’ had not already been rejected in advance as question begging or ‘hopelessly naive’?” Putnam’s natural realism holds on to the retort.

### 9. Button’s objection 

Tim Button (with Wright 2002) worries that this commitment to naïve realism is problematic. The naïve realist ties mind and world together metaphysically. That is fine. But the problem was epistemological: how can we tell our terms are about the world? Consider, a perception of a tree is indistinguishable from a corresponding hallucination of a tree. Descartes asked: can I really ever tell I am not dreaming? He thought not. In the worst case, even the naive realist should accept that our ideal theory about the world can be radically mistaken. Cartesianism doesn’t go away.

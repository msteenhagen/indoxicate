## _Short reflections on philosophy, society, and the dreadful state of the world_

Indoxicate is available for listening as well. All true podcasts use RSS [(Really Simple Syndication)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). This is a standardised way to distibute audio files and metadata. It allows you to listen to a podcast in whatever way you like. Download a podcast player app, or write one yourself. Alternatively, you can play podcasts on web-based services. 

Here's the RSS link (MP3) for Indoxicate: [RSS-feed](https://indoxicate.me/feed/mp3/)

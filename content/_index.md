## Welcome!

<img class="avatar" src="../img/about-img.jpg" alt="avatar">

Welcome to my website and blog. On these pages you can find regular blog entries and essays, as well as my [academic papers](/tags/academic/) and teaching materials. I mostly write about philosophy, psychology, and the dreadful state of the world. 

Should you want to know more about me, I have included a [biographical note](about/). You can also subscribe to my <a href="http://eepurl.com/idUvuf" target="blank">newsletter</a> or <a href="http://indoxicate.me/atom.xml">RSS feed</a>.

<!-- For information about how to contact me, please consult my [contact page](contact/).  -->

If you like, you can follow me on <a rel="me" href="https://provo.lol/@msteenhagen" class="external" target="_blank" hreflang="en" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastodon</a> as well.

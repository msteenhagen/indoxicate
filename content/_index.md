# Maarten Steenhagen

Welcome to my personal website. On these pages you can find regular blog posts, occasional essays, and academic papers and teaching materials. I mostly write about philosophy, psychology, and the dreadful state of the world. 

Should you want to know more about me, I have included a [biographical note](about/). For information about how to contact me, please consult my [contact page](contact/). 

If you like, you can follow me on {{< link src="https://provo.lol/@msteenhagen" class="external" target="_blank" hreflang="en" rel="me" >}}Mastodon{{< /link >}} as well.

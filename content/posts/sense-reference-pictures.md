In this paper I argue that a theory of pictorial representation does not require a sense/reference distinction.

### Abstract:

John Hyman insists that Frege-style cases for depiction show that any sound theory of depiction must distinguish between the ‘sense’ and the ‘reference’ of a picture. I argue that this rests on a mistake. Making sense of the cases does not require the distinction.

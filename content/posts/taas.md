In several wealthy countries basic literacy is declining year on year. Here I want to focus on The Netherlands, a country I understand well. In the [most recent PISA report](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/), which looked at data from 2018, The Netherlands performed poorly given its wealth, trailing well behind Estonia, Singapore, and China.

The report was no surprise. The Dutch Education Council [has tried to raise awareness](https://www.onderwijsraad.nl/publicaties/adviezen/2019/06/24/leesadvies) of this decline for years, yet there is no sign anything significant is happening to counter it. Why aren't we seeing a more concerted effort to invest in and improve education?  

For, surely, it matters a lot. Reading skills are more than the ability to reproduce a text, but are a condition for comprehension as well. Indeed, the PISA score measured precisely comprehension, "the capacity to understand, use and reflect on written texts in order to achieve goals, develop knowledge and potential, and participate in society". 

Someone who struggles with reading is likely to struggle with writing as well. And indeed, also [when we look at the ability to write](https://www.onderwijsinspectie.nl/onderwerpen/peil-onderwijs/schrijfvaardigheid-einde-sbo), the majority of Dutch children leaves primary school with writing skills that fall below what the desirable threshold. In fact, a quarter of school-leavers does not even possess the most basic level of writerly skill. 

Anyone who is familiar with Dutch society should already be able to see the effects of this on everyday life in the Netherlands. 

## Cognitive deskilling

Needless to say, this is not the fault of children. I think it is fairly uncontroversial to see the decline in literacy and comprehension as a systemic failing, a result of how society at large has ceased to value the ability to read, write, and to reflect and understand. 

In this light, I think it crucial to see these declines against the backdrop of a much bigger picture, one that extends well beyond the specific of the education system. 

More and more, _thinking itself_ is being turned into a service, a product that is offered by some company or other. When people look for answers or want to understand something, they turn to Google or social media. There, they are likely to find easily digestible, byte-sized snippets that will do for most practical purposes. Consultancy, instead of being a specialist service, has been pushed to the mainstream. 

I think that examples are everywhere. Instead of reading a manual, people will find the solution to a problem with their laptop or dishwasher as a 'top hit' on a search engine. Instead of reading a news article or analysis piece, people will base their view of what's happening on a gist that was distilled on social media. More and more do we rely on autocompletion of emails, and automatically generated messages. Moreover, with the advent of 'Artificial Intelligence', such outsourced thinking increasingly takes place cheaply and automatically, without meaningful human intervention.

What I expect to see more and more is that thinking will become a service to which you'll have to subscribe, either by paying with money or with your data. This _Thinking as a Service_ model (TAAS) has been set in motion a long time ago, but I think we are only now beginning to see exactly how corrosive it is. It thrives on and promotes a specific kind of cognitive de-skilling. As any other form of market-driven de-skilling (think what happened to cooking, exercise, repairing, cycling, networking, etc.), the decline in reading and comprehension skills is a welcome and expanding opportunity for turning demand into profit. 

## The true causes of literacy decline

With this in mind, it comes as no surprise that [Google is increasingly infiltrating](https://edu.google.com/workspace-for-education/classroom/) the classroom, or that people are imagining a life in which ChatGPT takes care of your emails and tax returns. When we worry about declining literacy in societies that should very well be able to afford decent education, we should not look too narrowly when we look for causes. Instead, as always, we would do well to follow the money. The less capable people are to read, write, and understand, the easier it will be to exploit their helplessness for profit.
